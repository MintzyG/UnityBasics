# UnityBasics

Following Catlike Coding's Unity basics tutorials.

Done so far:

- [x] GameObjects and Scripts
- [ ] Building a Graph
- [ ] Mathmatical Surfaces
- [ ] Measuring Performance
- [ ] Compute Shaders
- [ ] Jobs
- [ ] Organic Variety

I'm using this to work towards starting Catlike Coding's Rendering series to then start to branch out in to Graphis programming.
